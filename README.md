# bookshelf-supermodel

A [Bookshelf.js](https://github.com/tgriesser/bookshelf) base model class with super powers. Not really.

I just found myself using several plugins and would find cases where they sometimes didnt play nicely. This is an effort to bring those plugins together to a single home that I can reuse.

### Inspiration

- [bookshelf-modelbase](https://github.com/bsiddiqui/bookshelf-modelbase). I liked this as a starting point, but cleaned up for 2020.
